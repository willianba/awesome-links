This repo is a follow-along course that is available at [this blog post](https://prisma.io/blog/fullstack-nextjs-graphql-prisma-oklidw1rhw) from Prisma.

## Running the project (WIP)

- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Set the db host in the `.env` file
  - PS: for the deployment to work, database should be cloud-hosted (the course used [postgres within heroku](https://www.heroku.com/postgres))
- Seed the database with `npx prisma db seed`
- Start with `npm run dev`
